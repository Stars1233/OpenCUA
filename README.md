<b>OpenCUA</b> is a comprehensive open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models, consisting of: 
- <b>[AgentNet](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xlangai/AgentNet)</b>: the first large-scale computer-use task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites; 
- **[AgentNetTool](https://agentnet-tool.xlang.ai/)**: an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human computer-use demonstrations; 
- <b>[AgentNetBench](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenCUA/tree/main/AgentNetBench)</b>: an offline evaluator that benchmarks model-predicted low-level actions against ground-truth trajectories.
- **[OpenCUA Models](https://huggingface.co/collections/xlangai/opencua-open-foundations-for-computer-use-agents-6882014ebecdbbe46074a68d")**: end-to-end computer-use foundation models than can produce executable actions in the computer environments with great planning and grounding capabilities.


With the help of OpenCUA framework, our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, <b>OpenCUA-32B</b> achieves an average success rate of **34.8%** on [OSWorld-Verified](https://os-world.github.io/), 
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models.

# AgentNetTool ‚Äì Annotation & Verification Tool
Our **AgentNetTool** is a cross-platform GUI recorder that runs unobtrusively on annotators‚Äô machines.  
It captures synchronized **screen video**, **mouse/keyboard events**, and **accessibility trees**, then provides an in-browser UI for reviewing, trimming, and submitting demonstrations.

# DataProcessor ‚Äì Action Reduction & State‚ÄìAction Matching
Raw demonstrations can contain thousands of low-level events that are too dense for model training.  
The **DataProcessor** module (`./DataProcessor/`) performs two key steps:

1. **Action Reduction** ‚Äî merges granular signals into concise, semantically meaningful PyAutoGUI actions (e.g., collapsing mouse moves ‚Üí click, coalescing scrolls, grouping key-press sequences into text or hotkeys).  
2. **State‚ÄìAction Matching** ‚Äî aligns every reduced action with the *last visually distinct frame* **before** the action begins, avoiding future-information leakage and yielding compact state‚Äìaction pairs.

These processed trajectories underlie all downstream training and evaluation.

---

# CoTGenerator ‚Äì Synthesizing Reflective Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
To boost robustness and interpretability, we augment each trajectory with **reflective long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning**.  
The **CoTGenerator** pipeline (`./CoTGenerator/`) synthesizes step-level reflections that:

* reflect on the previous action,
* explain *why* an action is chosen given the current observation and history,  
* note potential alternative actions, and  
* forecast the expected next state.

Empirically, models trained with these rich CoTs scale better with data and generalize across unseen applications.


# AgentNetBench ‚Äì Offline Evaluation

**AgentNetBench** (`./AgentNetBench/`) provides an offline evaluator for UI interaction trajectories. It compares model-predicted low-level actions (click, moveTo, write, press, scroll, terminate, etc.) against ground-truth actions and reports detailed metrics. See [AgentNetBench/README.md](./AgentNetBench/README.md) for usage instructions.
