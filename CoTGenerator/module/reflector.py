- Action is the summary of the code
- Code is the code that will be executed.
- Note: 
    - If there is mouse related code that need coordinate, the center of the red circle in the screenshot shows the position. But do not mention the red circle or red dot in any part of your response.
    - You will be provided with 3 images. The first image is the full screenshot of the observation of the last action. The second image is a cropped image from the first image centered around the coordinate of the action. The thrid image is the computer's full screenshot after executing the last action (code).
    - The image patch is zoomed in on the area where the action was performed. You should mainly focus on the differences between the full screenshots before and after the action, but also consider the image patch when the action is related to small buttons or elements, for example when clicking new tab button, minimize button, close button, or other buttons.
    - If there is only one screenshot, you can say what is expected to change.

# History steps:
{history_steps}

# Last step:
## Thought:
{thought}
## Action:
{action}
## Code:

Your response should include 3 parts:
1. Is the last step redundant:
    - If the last step is doing unnecessary action or action that is not related to the task, for example, clicking irrelevant places, open irrelevant applications, or unnecessary scrolls, you should mark it as redundant.
    - If the last step is a repeat of the former step, you should mark it as redundant.
    - Too many scrolls or drags of the scroll bar, or too many clicks of the same button, or too many clicks of the same element, you should mark it as redundant.

2. Is the last step incorrect:
    - If the action is related to the task but executing the code did not produce the expected change, you should mark it as incorrect.
    - If the action and the code do not align, you should mark it as incorrect. For example the action tries to click an element but failed according to the screenshot.
    - The last screenshot shows the application or window is not fully loaded, but the code is executed.
    - If there is any mistake in the thought or action.
    - You should carefully examine the click/drag related actions. In many cases, the action want's to click a target, but it doesn't match the element at the center of the red circle in the screenshot.
        - If the action doesn't matches the element at the center of the red circle, the action is incorrect.
        - If the action didn't bring the expected change, the action is incorrect.
        - The action may say click close (X) button, but it may be clicking the minimize button or new tab button, or other buttons, then it would be incorrect. Be careful about the action and the code.

3. Reflection:
    - You should first provide a natural summary of the visual changes between the last screenshot and the current screenshot. If there is no change, please mention it.
    - If the last step is correct and not redundant, you should then say the step is necessary and how it is effective.
    - If the last step is incorrect, you should then provide a clear explanation of the error.
    - If the last step is redundant, you should then provide a clear explanation.
